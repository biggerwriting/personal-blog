The file /personal-blog/personal-blog/src/assets/images/avatar.jpg is intended to be an image file. Since I cannot generate binary image content directly, please ensure you have an appropriate avatar image saved as "avatar.jpg" in that directory. 

If you need help with anything else, feel free to ask!
